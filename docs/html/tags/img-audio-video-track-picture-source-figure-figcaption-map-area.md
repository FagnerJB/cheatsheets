## Description

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.

### img

Embeds an image into the document.

### audio

Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.

### video

Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <**video**> for audio content, but the **audio** element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

### track

Used as a child of the media elements, **audio** and **video**. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) â€” Web Video Text Tracks.

### picture

Contains zero or more <**source**> elements and one **img** element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

### source

Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.

### figure

Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption or legend describing the rest of the contents, which is specified using the <**figcaption**> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

### figcaption

Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <**figure**> element.

### map

Used with **area** elements to define an image map, a clickable link area.

### area

Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.
