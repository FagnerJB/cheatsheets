## Description
Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element in {type:Sectioning} to represent it.

## Recommendations 
- Sections should always have a {type:Heading}, with very few exceptions.

## Example

```html
<section>
<h2></h2>
<p></p>
</section>
```
